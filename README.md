# Adaptive Hud

This plugin aims to provide a convienence feature of automatically swapping hudlayouts when the game goes into fullscreen and back. Particularly helpful for ultrawide players who switch frequently.

# Current status

I no longer play this game regularly and have decided to put this project on pause. I have no plans to fix any current issues but I will keep it updated for the current Dalamud API. PRs to fix issues are welcome and I'll merge them as I have motivation.

8/27/25 update: due to clownshit decisions by SE I am deeply uninterested in logging into this game at all. **Plugin will still be updated for new API versions, but will be untested!!!** Report any issues to feedback system in /xlplugins, the Dalamud Discord thread for this plugin, or on GitHub Issues here. Thanks!

# Known issues

None within the scope of the project at the moment.

# Issues

feel free to file issues in this repo or using the feedback system if thats enabled in /xlplugins.

In the event I am no longer playing this game, I'll make an effort to update this repo to indicate such and suggest forking. But I doubt this plugin will break unless Dalamud's API significantly changes.
