# Adaptive Hud

This plugin aims to provide a convienence feature of automatically swapping hudlayouts when the game goes into fullscreen and back. Particularly helpful for ultrawide players who switch frequently.

# Current status

I no longer play this game regularly and have decided to put this project on pause. I have no plans to fix any current issues but I will keep it updated for the current Dalamud API. PRs to fix issues are welcome and I'll merge them as I have motivation.

# Known issues

* ~~The hudlayout will switch when you toggle the setting in the UI before clicking apply. Reverting by clicking cancel will revert the hudlayout to what it should be. Minor issue.~~ (Fixed as of API9/XIV 6.5)
* ~~You might crash if you spam the hell out of the windowed mode radio buttons (5+ times in a few seconds). Don't do that.~~ (Fixed as of API9/XIV 6.5)

# Issues

feel free to file issues in this repo or using the feedback system if thats enabled in /xlplugins.

In the event I am no longer playing this game, I'll make an effort to update this repo to indicate such and suggest forking. But I doubt this plugin will break unless Dalamud's API significantly changes.
